This project is a .STL to .DAT Translator written in C++. 
The tool reads 3D model data from an STL (stereolithography) file, parses the vertex information, and exports the relevant coordinates into a .dat file. 
The .dat file can then be visualized using plotting tools like Gnuplot or used for further processing.
